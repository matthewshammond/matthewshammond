# 👋 Hi!

I am [Matt Hammond](https://matthammond.dev), a prior military professional with military aviation experience and Special Operations experience. As well as civilian aviation experience in helicopters and fixed wing stateside and abroad. I have turned an interest, hobby, and passion of IT related content into a strong knowledge in the areas of cyber network security analysis, DevOps tool administration, and information security system analysis by completing Security+, CEH, and Splunk Core User certifications. I will be using [Github](https://github.com/matthewshammond) and my [website](https://matthammond.dev) to continue my learning and as a place to implement what I learn.
